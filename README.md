    <h1>Riah's Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich</h1>
    <h2>By Mariah Henry</h2>
  <p>Riah's Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich is made before leaving out my home. Originally purchased from Howard's Deli, I decided to create my own version because not only do I not eat pork, but getting to the destination from the U St Metro is time consuming and the sandwich costs $4.50. Hence, not only am I saving time, energy, and money, but I also use healthier ingredients. Hence, I make four sandwiches for about $10 as opposed to purchasing four sanwiches for $20.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Service Size: 4</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Loaf of Wheat Bread</li>
      <li>8 Pack/Box of Pre-Cooked Turkey Patties</li>
      <li>1 Jar of Organic Jelly</li>
      <li>Deli-Style American Cheese Slices*</li>
      <li>1 Carton of Brown Eggs</li>
      <li>1 bottle of Spam</li>
      <li>1 bottle of Olive Oil (optional)</li>
      <p>*I usually purchase $2 or $3 worth of cheese from my local grocery store's deli</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>What to Do</h3>
    <p>The following directions are for the making of each sandwich:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Spray a skillet with Spam</li>
      <li>Warm-up 2 pre-cooked turkey patties as desired in skillet</li>
      <li>Melt 1 slice of american cheese on top of turkey patties</li>
      <li>Pour a little olive oil into another skillet and crack open an egg for frying (if a fried egg is not preferred,then scramble in a bowl before cooking). Fry until desired (I fry until my egg is no longer runny)</li> 
      <li>While cooking egg, place two slices of bread in the toaster until golden brown and toasted</li>
      <li>Once toasted; using a knife spread jelly onto both slices of bread</li>
      <li>Place patties and egg on one side of the bread topped with the other slice</li>
      <li>Cut the sandwich in half and voila! Breakfast is Served, Enjoy (:</li>
